              <h3>Dispute resolution</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>YOU AND COGNOSPHERE DYNAMICS AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION
                  WAIVER PROVISIONS:</strong>
              </p>
              <p><strong>MANDATORY ARBITRATION.</strong> You and OpenAI agree to resolve any claims arising out of or
                relating to these
                Terms or our Services, regardless of when the claim arose, even if it was before these Terms existed (a
                “Dispute”), through final and binding arbitration. You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of
                account creation or of any updates to these arbitration terms within 30 days after the update has taken
                effect by filling out this form(opens in a new window). If you opt out of an update, the last set of
                agreed upon arbitration terms will apply. </p>

              <p><strong>Informal dispute resolution.</strong> We would like to understand and try to address your
                concerns prior to
                formal legal action. Before either of us files a claim against the other, we both agree to try to
                resolve the Dispute informally. You agree to do so by sending us notice through this form(opens in a new
                window). We will do so by sending you notice to the email address associated with your account. If we
                are unable to resolve a Dispute within 60 days, either of us has the right to initiate arbitration. We
                also both agree to attend an individual settlement conference if either party requests one during this
                time. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during this informal resolution process.</p>

              <p><strong>Arbitration forum.</strong> If we are unable to resolve the Dispute, either of us may commence
                arbitration with National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution
                Rules and Procedures and/or Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable (available
                here(opens in a new window)). OpenAI will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the
                arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. The activities described in these Terms involve
                interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of
                these arbitration terms and any arbitration.</p>

              <p><strong>Arbitration procedures.</strong> The arbitration will be conducted by videoconference if
                possible, but if the arbitrator determines a hearing should be conducted in person, the location will be
                mutually agreed upon, in the county where you reside, or as determined by the arbitrator, unless the
                batch arbitration process applies. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator. The
                arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of
                California. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, except the state or
                federal courts of San Francisco, California have the authority to determine any Dispute about
                enforceability, validity of the class action waiver, or requests for public injunctive relief, as set
                out below. Any settlement offer amounts will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until
                after the arbitrator determines the final award, if any. The arbitrator has the authority to grant
                motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. </p>

              <p><strong>Exceptions.</strong> This section does not require informal dispute resolution or arbitration
                of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or
                other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property
                infringement or misappropriation.</p>

              <p><strong>CLASS AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS.</strong> You and OpenAI agree that Disputes must be brought on an
                individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class,
                consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions, and representative
                actions are prohibited. Only individual relief is available. The parties agree to sever and litigate in
                court any request for public injunctive relief after completing arbitration for the underlying claim and
                all other claims. This does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement. You
                and OpenAI knowingly and irrevocably waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or
                counterclaim. </p>

              <p><strong>Batch arbitration.</strong> If 25 or more claimants represented by the same or similar counsel
                file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes within 90 days of each other, then
                you and OpenAI agree that NAM will administer them in batches of up to 50 claimants each (“Batch”),
                unless there are less than 50 claimants in total or after batching, which will comprise a single Batch.
                NAM will administer each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of
                arbitration fees, and one hearing held by videoconference or in a location decided by the arbitrator for
                each Batch. If any part of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable as to a particular
                claimant or Batch, it will be severed and arbitrated in individual proceedings. </p>

              <p><strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of these arbitration terms is found to be illegal or
                unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or
                unenforceability would allow class arbitration, class action, or representative action, this entire
                dispute resolution section will be unenforceable in its entirety.</p>
