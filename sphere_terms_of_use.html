                <p>
                  <strong>Informal dispute resolution.</strong> We would like to
                  understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal
                  legal action. Before either of us files a claim against the
                  other, we both agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally.
                  You agree to do so by sending us notice through this
                  form(opens in a new window). We will do so by sending you
                  notice to the email address associated with your account. If
                  we are unable to resolve a Dispute within 60 days, either of
                  us has the right to initiate arbitration. We also both agree
                  to attend an individual settlement conference if either party
                  requests one during this time. Any statute of limitations will
                  be tolled during this informal resolution process.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Arbitration forum.</strong> If we are unable to
                  resolve the Dispute, either of us may commence arbitration
                  with National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) under its
                  Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or
                  Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable
                  (available here(opens in a new window)). Cognosphere Dynamics
                  will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless
                  the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. The
                  activities described in these Terms involve interstate
                  commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the
                  interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration terms and
                  any arbitration.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Arbitration procedures.</strong> The arbitration will
                  be conducted by videoconference if possible, but if the
                  arbitrator determines a hearing should be conducted in person,
                  the location will be mutually agreed upon, in the county where
                  you reside, or as determined by the arbitrator, unless the
                  batch arbitration process applies. The arbitration will be
                  conducted by a sole arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either
                  a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the
                  state of California. The arbitrator will have exclusive
                  authority to resolve any Dispute, except the state or federal
                  courts of San Francisco, California have the authority to
                  determine any Dispute about enforceability, validity of the
                  class action waiver, or requests for public injunctive relief,
                  as set out below. Any settlement offer amounts will not be
                  disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the
                  arbitrator determines the final award, if any. The arbitrator
                  has the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part
                  of any Dispute.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Exceptions.</strong> This section does not require
                  informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the following
                  claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court;
                  and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop
                  unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual
                  property infringement or misappropriation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>CLASS AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS.</strong> You and
                  Cognosphere Dynamics agree that Disputes must be brought on an
                  individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff
                  or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or
                  representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions,
                  and representative actions are prohibited. Only individual
                  relief is available. The parties agree to sever and litigate
                  in court any request for public injunctive relief after
                  completing arbitration for the underlying claim and all other
                  claims. This does not prevent either party from participating
                  in a class-wide settlement. You and Cognosphere Dynamics
                  knowingly and irrevocably waive any right to trial by jury in
                  any action, proceeding, or counterclaim.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Batch arbitration.</strong> If 25 or more claimants
                  represented by the same or similar counsel file demands for
                  arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes within 90
                  days of each other, then you and Cognosphere Dynamics agree
                  that NAM will administer them in batches of up to 50 claimants
                  each (“Batch”), unless there are less than 50 claimants in
                  total or after batching, which will comprise a single Batch.
                  NAM will administer each Batch as a single consolidated
                  arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees,
                  and one hearing held by videoconference or in a location
                  decided by the arbitrator for each Batch. If any part of this
                  section is found to be invalid or unenforceable as to a
                  particular claimant or Batch, it will be severed and
                  arbitrated in individual proceedings.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of these
                  arbitration terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the
                  remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of
                  partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class
                  arbitration, class action, or representative action, this
                  entire dispute resolution section will be unenforceable in its
                  entirety.
